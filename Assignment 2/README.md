## How to play

### Main Concept
Falling shapes will appear from above and slowly fall towards the bottom of the screen.
Use the joystick to move the shape left or right and place shapes. A shape is placed when
any points in the shape is above an already placed shape or on the bottom of the screen.
<br />

### Aim
The aim for the player is to place the shapes in such a way that an entire row (line) is lit up. This
will cause the corresponding line to be removed and all lines above shifted downwards. A player loses
when any of the top row lights are lit up after a shape has been placed.
<br />

## Controls

### Navigation Switch / Joystick:

#### 1) Navswitch Left and Right
Pushing the navswitch to the left or right will cause the current falling shape to move either left or
right respectively, this may only occur if there is space to do so.

#### 3) Navswitch Push
Pushing the navswitch inwards will cause the current object to rotate clockwise. Once again, this
may only occur if there is space to do so.

#### 4) Navswitch Down
Pushing the navswitch down will automatically place the object in the first location downwards it can be.
This will be important to quickly remove layers while versing your opponent.
<br>

## Sending Lines
If the player is able to remove two lines within a single placement of a shape, a "junk line" will be sent
towards the opponent. A junk line is a fully completed row with 1 light missing. This junk line is placed
at the very bottom of the screen causing all other rows to be shifted upwards.

## Scoreboard:
The scoreboard will display after each round displaying "'users score' - 'enemy score'"
Pressing the navswitch in will take you back to the waiting screen.
